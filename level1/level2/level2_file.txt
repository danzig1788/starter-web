Â¡Soy loco por los Cornballs! It's one banana Michael, what could it cost, ten dollars? I think that's one of Mom's little fibs, you know, like I'll sacrifice anything for my children. Look at us, crying like a couple of girls on the last day of camp. I'M A MONSTER!! These are my awards, Mother. From Army. The seal is for marksmanship, and the gorilla is for sand racing. I mean, it's one banana, Michael. What could it cost, ten dollars? I made a huge tiny mistake.
